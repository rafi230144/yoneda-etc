Yoneda, its standard corollaries, free (co)completions, and Isbell duality.

Main file is `/yoneda-etc.tex`.

Typechecked by hand (in principle one could write a small DSL for representing functors/natural transformations as composable functorial lambdas; perhaps a good side project for the future), so expect errors.

The particular conventions chosen re dualizing objects/functors/natural transformations and manipulating elements of dual sets (and especially those of dual hom sets) are likely supotimal; I did not think too long about the choices made here.
